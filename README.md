This repo provides the source code & data of our paper:" **Learning Universal Knowledge Graph Embedding for Predicting Biomedical Pairwise Interactions**"
## Overview
Here, we propose **LukePi** (**L**earning **u**niversal **k**nowledge graph **e**mbedding for predicting biomedical **P**airwise **i**nteractions), a novel self-supervised pre-training framework for predicting various types of biomedical interactions. Extensive experiments on two pairwise interaction tasks demonstrate LukePiâ€™s outstanding predictive performance and strong generalizability.
